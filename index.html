                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I currently live in Harrisonburg, VA and am pursuing an Interactive Design Degree at James Madison
 University as a 22-year-old upperclassmen. I am currently in JMU's <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/smad/index.shtml" target="_blank">SMAD program</a>. I graduated from Brentsville District High School in
 2021 with a 3.6 GPA and was a member of leadership and public speaking classes. I also completed my
 PowerPoint certification whilst in high school. I have past retail experience seasonally at STAGE stores in
 Manassas and helped with the opening/closing of their new department store. I engaged frequently with the
 customers and provided customer service. I also had experience with stocking, processing, and basic
        sanitation. In the summer of 2022, I worked with ABM Aviation at <a href="https://www.flydulles.com/" target="_blank">Dulles International Airport</a> as a
 Cabin agent. It was an extremely fast paced job where I learned the importance of teamwork,
 communication, and how to perform tasks quickly with others in order to provide a safe environment for
 international and domestic flight goers.</p>
